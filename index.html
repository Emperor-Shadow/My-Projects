         <h3>HTML</h3>
         <p>HTML is a markup language used in the creation of websites and web applications. It stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard markup language used to create webpages. HTML is a platform independent language, meaning it can be used in any operating system and across different web browsers.

HTML code instructs the web browser how to display the content of a web page. HTML has its own syntax, defined with tags and elements. A tag defines the start and end of an element, and inside these tags, you can define attributes to further define the meaning of an element. HTML offers different types of elements for formatting, such as headings and paragraphs, tables, forms, images, videos and lists.

HTML works in conjunction with other languages, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, to create a fully-featured website. CSS is used to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in HTML, while JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

HTML is a powerful language and the foundation of the web. It enables the coded representation of webpages, in anticipation of a browser request. It is important to have a good understanding of HTML in order to create and build successful webpages. HTML helps to ensure a quality experience for the users of your website, no matter what device they may be using.</p>

         <h3>CSS</h3>
         <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for styling webpages. It's responsible for defining the look and feel of a webpage, including fonts, colors, and layout settings. CSS is used to control the styling of webpages, including its layout, as well as adding visual effects, like gradients and drop shadows.

CSS is a simple language that's easy to learn and can quickly improve the look of any webpage with minimal effort. It's a declarative language, meaning it only requires you to provide instructions for styling a webpage, rather than having to write code. On top of that, the syntax is intuitive and easy to understand.

You can use CSS to control the positioning and size of elements on the page, such as the layout of the main content, navigation, or sidebars. You can use it to adjust the location of various text elements, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists. CSS also allows you to change the appearance of text, including font size and color. You can also use it to add background images and colors, as well as adjust the margins and padding around page elements to create a more visually pleasing layout.

Furthermore, CSS is also used to set the default font size, line height, and other typographical settings. This allows you to create webpages that are more readable and easier on the eyes. Finally, you can use CSS to add visual effects, such as drop shadows, gradients, and transitions. This helps give webpages a more visually appealing look.

In conclusion, CSS is a powerful style sheet language that can quickly improve the look of a webpage with minimal effort. It allows you to control how the webpage is laid out, as well as adjust the font size, color, and line height.</p>

         <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
         <p>Javascript is a versatile, high-level computer programming language. It is a language used by web developers to create interactive elements on websites, such as dynamic images, forms, and menus. Javascript is supported by all major browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. 

Javascript can be used to create, manipulate, and control webpages, but also offers full-fledged application development capabilities. When used as an application platform, websites are capable of integrating server-side languages such as PHP and ASP into their design. This allows developers to create a more dynamic web experience by utilizing server-side databases, like MySQL.

Common uses for Javascript include: the implementation of client-side scripting, creating interactive menus, and creating more efficient web browsing experiences. It can also be used to create interactive user interfaces, such as online quizzes, chats, and games.

Most modern web browsers include built-in Javascript interpreters, and Javascript can be used to code in multiple languages. This includes ActionScript, XML, ECMAScript, Flash, AJAX, and Java.

For those unfamiliar with JavaScript, coding can be a daunting task. Thankfully tutorials, cheat sheets, and online communities are available to aid beginners in the learning process. Fortunately, many development frameworks and libraries exist to simplify coding tasks and maintain an organized codebase.

In conclusion, Javascript is an incredibly powerful and versatile programming language which is core to many elements of the modern web experience. With user-friendly development tools, tutorials, and online communities, coding can be easily accessible to even beginners.</p>
